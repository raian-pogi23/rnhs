	  <h1>STEM</h1>
      <p>STEM stands for "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics". It is a strand under the Academic track in the Senior High School (SHS) program in the Philippines. The STEM strand focuses on developing the students' knowledge and skills in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, which are considered as crucial for the country's economic and technological development.
<br><br>
		Students who choose STEM as their strand will take subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Calculus, and Computer Science, among others. They will also be exposed to various laboratory experiments, research projects, and competitions to hone their analytical, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
		<br><br>
		After completing the STEM strand, students can pursue further studies in various fields such as engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, medicine, and other science-related courses. Alternatively, they can also work in various industries such as research and development, information technology, manufacturing, energy, and telecommunications, or even pursue careers in public service or governance that require strong technical and analytical skills.
