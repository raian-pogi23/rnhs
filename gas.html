	  <h1>GAS</h1>
      <p>GAS stands for "General Academic Strand". It is a strand under the Academic track in the Senior High School (SHS) program in the Philippines. The GAS strand is designed for students who are undecided or have a broad range of interests and want to explore various fields before deciding on a specific course or career path.
<br><br>
		Students who choose GAS as their strand will take a variety of subjects from different academic fields such as Mathematics, Science, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Communication. They will also be exposed to various real-life scenarios and practices through internships, industry visits, and case studies.
		<br><br>
		After completing the GAS strand, students can pursue further studies in any field that interests them, depending on their aptitude and inclination. Alternatively, they can also start their own businesses or work in various industries such as finance, sales, marketing, research, and development, or even pursue careers in public service or governance.
