	  <h1>HUMSS</h1>
      <p>HUMSS stands for "Humanities and Social Sciences". It is a strand under the Academic track in the Senior High School (SHS) program in the Philippines. The HUMSS strand focuses on developing the students' knowledge and skills in the fields of literature, language, social sciences, and the arts.
<br><br>
		Students who choose HUMSS as their strand will take subjects such as Philippine Politics and Governance, Creative Writing, World Religions and Belief Systems, and Introduction to Anthropology, among others. They will also be exposed to various forms of art and culture, and will have opportunities to express their creativity through performances, exhibitions, and other artistic activities.
		<br><br>
		After completing the HUMSS strand, students can pursue further studies in various fields such as history, sociology, anthropology, literature, communication, or even law. Alternatively, they can also work in various industries such as journalism, media, advertising, public relations, or even the arts and entertainment industry.
