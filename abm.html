	  <h1>ABM</h1>
      <p>ABM stands for "Accountancy, Business, and Management". It is a strand under the Academic track in the Senior High School (SHS) program in the Philippines. The ABM strand focuses on developing the students' knowledge and skills in the fields of accounting, business, entrepreneurship, and management.
<br><br>
		Students who choose ABM as their strand will take subjects such as Principles of Marketing, Fundamentals of Accounting, Business Ethics and Social Responsibility, and Business Finance. They will also be exposed to real-life business scenarios and practices through internships, industry visits, and case studies.
		<br><br>
		After completing the ABM strand, students can pursue further studies in business-related courses such as accountancy, management, marketing, entrepreneurship, or even law. Alternatively, they can also start their own businesses or work in various industries such as banking, finance, sales, and marketing.
